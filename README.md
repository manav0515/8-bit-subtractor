# 8-bit-subtractor
This project demonstrates a complete ASIC design flow for a basic 8-bit subtractor, implemented using Verilog and synthesized through the RTL to GDSII flow using Synopsys tools such as Design Compiler and IC Compiler II.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Design: - Unsigned 8-bit subtractor (`A - B`)
- Inputs: - A[7:0], B[7:0]
- Outputs: - Diff[7:0], Borrow
- RTL Language: - Verilog HDL
- Toolchain: - Synopsys Design Compiler (DC) + IC Compiler II (ICC2)
- Flow: - RTL â†’ Synthesis â†’ Floorplanning â†’ Placement â†’ Routing â†’ GDSII

## ðŸ§  Functional Description

```verilog
assign {borrow, diff} = A - B;
